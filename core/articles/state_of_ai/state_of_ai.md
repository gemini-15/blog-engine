# The state of AI and cybersecurity today and what could be next

## Background

For the quick intro about me, I’m an AI security engineer working at a company that builds AI Agents. I’ve been working in AI security for 3 years now (I can fairly say that I’ve start before chatGPT was released), building secure and confidential AI inference and training infrastructures, AI BOM software etc..And I've been working in cybersecurity for around 5 years.

I wanted to present here an overview of the state of *AI for security* and *AI security* today (Yes they are completely different). 

## Current landspace of AI for security 

### Machine learning use in cybersecurity 

*AI for security* aims to design new tools and new methods for cybersecurity purposes using ML and LLMs.

Machine Learning Models have been implemented in defensive measures for a long time now. In **EDR (Endpoint Detection Response)** or **XDR (eXtended Detection Response)** use Machine Learning and behavioral analysis for threat detection for example. While the effectiveness of these products is better than an AV or nothing at all, the protection mechanisms are debatable (they still get bypassed under certain conditions).

Machine learning has also been a to-go field of research when it comes to building better fuzzing tools. In AFL++, we have many papers talking about it.  


### Cybersecurity since foundational models 

In the wake of Foundational Models, we're starting to see even more possibilities than before. One substantial example is the capability to test a vulnerability as fast as a CVE appears, whether maliciously or in the intent to prevent for an attack. 

In the offensive side, it's a little bit worse, ideas are shooting. One particularly interesting example is a fileless C2 server.
