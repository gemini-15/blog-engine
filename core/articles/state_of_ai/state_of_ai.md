# The state of AI and cybersecurity today and what could be next

## Background

For the quick intro about me, I’m an AI security engineer working at a company that builds AI Agents. I’ve been working in AI security for 3 years now (I can fairly say that I’ve start before chatGPT was released ) and in cybersecurity for more than 5 years for companies and startups. 

I wanted to present here an overview of the state of AI for security and AI security today (Yes they are completely different). 

## What’s the difference? 

AI security is for building protective measures around AI systems. 

AI for security aims to design new tools and new methods for cybersecurity purposes using ML and LLMs.
