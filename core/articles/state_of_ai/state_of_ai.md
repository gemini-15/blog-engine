# The state of AI and cybersecurity today and what could be next

## Background

For the quick intro about me, I’m an AI security engineer working at a company that builds AI Agents. I’ve been working in AI security for 3 years now (I can fairly say that I’ve start before chatGPT was released), building secure and confidential AI inference and training infrastructures, AI BOM software and so on. And I've been working in cybersecurity for around 5 years now.

I wanted to present here an overview of AI/ML security as I view it today.
